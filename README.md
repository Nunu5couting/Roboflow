## üëã hello

This is a specialized fork of the official Roboflow sports repository, enhanced with professional-grade football analytics. Building upon robust computer vision foundations, this implementation transforms raw detections into actionable tactical insights used by modern football analysis.

## üéØ Key Analytics Features Added
Advanced Metrics Pipeline

- üìä Real-Time Ball Possession Analysis - Precise team possession tracking with confidence scoring
- ‚öΩ Intelligent Pass Detection - Automated counting of successful passes per team with turnover differentiation
- üîÑ Dynamic Possession Flow - Live tracking of possession changes and momentum shifts throughout matches
- ‚è© Ball Speed Calculation - Live tracking of the ball speed

## üé¨ Analytics Feature Demo

## üß† Implementation Architecture
### Perspective-Corrected Distance Analysis

- 2D Field Mapping: Eliminates camera perspective distortion using detected pitch keypoints
- Calibrated Measurements: Converts pixel distances to real-world field coordinates
- Multi-Player Evaluation: Simultaneous distance calculation across all players and goalkeepers

### Intelligent Possession Algorithm

- Distance-Based Core: Determines possession using proximity analysis between ball and players
- Temporal Smoothing: 3-frame smoothing window eliminates detection noise and false possession changes

### Advanced Pass Recognition

- Team Continuity Logic: Distinguishes successful passes from turnovers by monitoring team possession consistency
- Player Transition Detection: Tracks ball movement between teammates using persistent player IDs
- Statistical Validation: Filters false positives through temporal analysis and possession stability checks

## üíª install

We don't have a Python package yet. Install from source in a
[**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KomisD/sports.git
```
